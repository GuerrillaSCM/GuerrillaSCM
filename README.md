IDK How to make issues so ill put it here

1. Analytics should only be accessible after clicking a survey
2. Analytics page is hard coded rn, but once a react route has been created i think it would be pretty straight forward to hook it up

This works but theres an issue with creating a new survey and refreshing the page
issue is on window.location.pathname or something
